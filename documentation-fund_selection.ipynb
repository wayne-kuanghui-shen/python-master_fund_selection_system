    "# Python Project: Master Fund Selection System\n",
    "## by Wayne (Kuanghui) Shen\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u> **WHY** </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a sound portfolio requires getting many things right and hiring the right professional managers is one of them. **Historically, top quartile managers within each asset class have outperformed the related index**, despite the issues cited in research around survivorship bias. The compounding effect of of a manager's excess return can have a meaningful impact on oneâ€™s wealth over time. **So this project aims to identify the top-performaning funds using a quantitative approach, based on past performance and other aspects of the funds.** The result of this Master Fund Selection System can serve as a starting point of a comprehensive manager due diligence, by filtering the top performaning funds within each asset class. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <u> **HOW** </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "In search of the top-performaning funds, we need to go though the following four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(1) Define The Fund Universe**\n",
    "   - The original fund pool is generated from **Bloomberg Fund Screening (FSRC)** with specified fund domicile and fund type\n",
    "   - Fund domicile included: United States, United Kingdom, Guernsey, Jersey\n",
    "   - Fund type included: : ETF, Closed-Ended Fund, Open-Ended Fund, Open-Ended Investment Company, Investment Trust, Unit Trust, Fund of Fund\n",
    "   - In aggregate, **14823 funds are included along with their categorical profile, annualized returns, AUM, Sharpe ratio, dividend yield and fee**\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **(2) Categorize The Funds**\n",
    "    - To rank the funds, we first need to categorize them as different strategies have different risk-return profile\n",
    "    - The funds are **first classified by asset classes then further divided into subgroups based on the specific strategies or regions**\n",
    "    - The subgroups are adjusted by the distributions of funds given the uneven numbers of funds in each group\n",
    "    - In terms of regions, only \"United States\", \"Global\", \"International\" and \"Emerging Markets\" are separated grouped.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Asset Class | Fund Group | | \n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Equity** | United States | Broad / Growth / Value / Large-cap / Mid-cap / Small-cap / Income / Low-vol / Quality / Tech sector / Non-tech sector \n",
    "|            | Other Regions | Global / International / EM / Others\n",
    "| **Fixed Income** | United States | Aggregate / Government / Corporate / Municipal / Money Market / Mortgage-Backed / Asset-Backed / TIPs / Convertible-Preferred\n",
    "|                  | Other Regions | Global / International / EM / Others\n",
    "| **Alternative** | Broad Alternatives | Multi-Strategy / Private Equity / Real Estate / Commodity / Digital Currency \n",
    "|                 | Hedge Fund | Equity Hedge / Fixed Income / Event Driven / Managed Futures / Macro Strategy\n",
    "|                 | Mixed Allocation | US Mixed Allocation / Global Mixed Allocation / Other Mixed Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(3) Identify The Funds' Potential Risks**\n",
    "    - To identify the potential risks involved investing in each fund, a fund warning analysis is conducted and comments are marked\n",
    "        - **Risk I: *\"AUM<$100M\"***, as smaller funds offer limited liquidity and have higher chances to liquidate\n",
    "        - **Risk II: *\"Sharpe<0\"***, as negative sharpe ratio implies no excess riks-adjusted return generated by the funds\n",
    "         - We would also like to mark the ***\"missing data\"***, including AUM and sharpe ratio, as this would make the funds incomparable with each other\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **(4) Create Fund Selection Criteria**\n",
    "    - Before createing the selection criteria, **certain funds are eliminated** from the list given \n",
    "        - ***\"missing returns\"*** : unable to rank based on performance\n",
    "        - ***\"AUM<$30M\"*** : to small and illiquid to invest in\n",
    "        - ***\"inception < 5yr\"*** : not long enough track records to examine consistently-outperforming funds\n",
    "    - The fund selection process is **based on weighted average return (WAR), which combines the annualized returns of different horizons with more weights on longer horizons, as they demonstrate consistent outperformance**. The weighted average return formula is as follows:\n",
    "        - For funds with inception > 10y: WAR = 50% * 10y Ann. Return + 30% * 5y Ann. Return + 20% * 3y Ann. Return\n",
    "        - For funds with 5y < inception < 10y: WAR = 60% * 5y Ann. Return + 40% * 3y Ann. Return\n",
    "    - The weighted average returns are then **tranformed into deciles to show the relative ranks of each fund**\n",
    "    - Note: the wegihted average return formula is designed according to [*\"Morningstar Ratings for Funds\"*](https://www.morningstar.com/content/dam/marketing/shared/research/methodology/771945_Morningstar_Rating_for_Funds_Methodology.pdf)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### <u> **WHAT** </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Master Fund Selection System provides a quantitative approach to identify top-performaning funds**, by:\n",
    "- (1) categorizing the funds based on the underlying strategies and/or regions\n",
    "- (2) marking the potential risks related to each fund such as small AUM and low Sharpe ratio\n",
    "- (3) eliminating the funds that don't have long-enough track records and sufficient fund size\n",
    "- (4) creating weighted average returns that combines the annualized returns of different horizons to rank the funds\n",
    "\n",
    "**The output of the system is an interactive data table that allows the users to choose the fund group of interest and generate a selected number of funds based on weighted average returns or other benchmarks, with the option to filter by minimum AUM, Sharpe ration or dividend yield.**"
