# *Master Fund Selection System*

**✏️ Introduction**: Hiring the right professional managers is key to successful portfolio construction. By identifying the top-performing funds, we can potentially beat passive indice and generate excess risk-adjusted returns

## ⛳️ Objectives 
- Categorize liquid investment funds by asset class, region and strategy
- Create return-based metrics to rank the funds with heavier weights on longer horizons
- Identify quantitatively the general risks of investing in a fund

## 📍 Solutions
- The Master Fund Selection System provides a quantitative approach to rank top-performaning funds based on weighted average returns of different horizons
- Funds are classified by their risk-return profile and adjusted by the distributions of overall funds
- Funds with shorter track record and limited size are eliminated and potential risks associated are marked
- The interactive data table allows users to choose a fund group and generate the funds ranked by weighted average returns, with the option to filter the fund list by minimum AUM, Sharpe ration or dividend yield.
