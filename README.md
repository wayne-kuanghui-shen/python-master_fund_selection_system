# *Master Fund Selection System*

**✏️ Introduction**: Hiring the right professional managers is key to successful portfolio construction. By identifying the top-performing funds, we can potentially beat the passive indice and generate excess returns after adjusting for risks. 

## ⛳️ Objectives 
- Categorize liquid investment funds by asset class, region and strategy
- Create return-based metrics to rank the funds with heavier weights on longer horizons
- Identify quantitatively the general risks of investing in a fund

## 📍 Solutions
- The Master Fund Selection System provides a quantitative approach to rank top-performaning funds based on weighted average returns of different horizons
- Funds are classified by their risk-return profile and the subgroups are adjusted by the distributions of overall funds
- Funds with shorter track records and limited sizes are eliminated and potential risks such as small AUM and low Sharpe ratio are marked
- The output, an interactive data table, allows users to choose the fund group of interest and generate a selected number of funds based on weighted average returns, with the option to filter by minimum AUM, Sharpe ration or dividend yield.
